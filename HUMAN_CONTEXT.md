# Human Context

This document provides guidance for human contributors working on the Clocky project.

## Project Philosophy

This project inverts the typical AI assistant relationship. Instead of the AI being an assistant to the human developer, the human acts as an assistant to the AI. This approach tests the limits of AI-driven development while maintaining human oversight for quality and safety.

## Your Role

As a human contributor, your primary role is to:

1. **Execute Operations**
   - Run commands provided by the AI
   - Manage git operations and branches
   - Handle file system operations
   - Execute build and test commands

2. **Provide Testing & Feedback**
   - Test implemented features
   - Report bugs and issues
   - Provide UX feedback
   - Suggest improvements
   - Test edge cases

3. **Make Final Decisions**
   - Review and approve code changes
   - Decide when to merge features
   - Determine project priorities
   - Approve architectural decisions

4. **Guide AI Understanding**
   - Clarify requirements
   - Explain project context
   - Describe user needs
   - Share technical constraints

## Working with AI

When interacting with the AI:

1. **Be Clear and Specific**
   - Provide detailed feedback
   - Explain issues thoroughly
   - Share relevant context
   - Describe expected behavior

2. **Allow AI Leadership**
   - Let AI make architectural decisions
   - Allow AI to suggest implementations
   - Give AI space to plan features
   - Follow AI's technical guidance

3. **Provide Timely Feedback**
   - Test features promptly
   - Report issues immediately
   - Share concerns early
   - Confirm successful implementations

## Development Process

1. **Feature Planning**
   - Listen to AI's proposed approach
   - Share relevant constraints
   - Provide business context
   - Confirm requirements

2. **Implementation**
   - Execute AI's instructions
   - Follow provided commands
   - Report any issues
   - Share progress

3. **Testing**
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document issues
   - Verify edge cases
   - Confirm fixes

4. **Review & Merge**
   - Review changes
   - Request clarification if needed
   - Approve when satisfied
   - Handle merges

## Best Practices

1. **Communication**
   - Be specific about issues
   - Share complete error messages
   - Provide context for changes
   - Ask for clarification when needed

2. **Testing**
   - Test features thoroughly
   - Try edge cases
   - Verify fixes
   - Test across different screens/states

3. **Version Control**
   - Follow AI's branching guidance
   - Keep commits focused
   - Use suggested commit messages
   - Maintain clean history

4. **Project Management**
   - Help prioritize features
   - Track open issues
   - Manage merges
   - Maintain documentation
